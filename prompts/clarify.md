Please read specs/001-market-sentiment-dashboard/checklists/requirements.md and draft concise clarification questions for any ambiguous requirements, missing acceptance criteria, external dependencies (APIs/data sources), and edge cases. Return the questions grouped by topic (data, UI/UX, performance, rollout/testing).

Read the review and acceptance checklist, and check off each item in the checklist if the feature spec meets the criteria. Leave it empty if it does not.
